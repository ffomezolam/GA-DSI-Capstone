# Models Directory

`/models/`

By default all saved models are placed here. Default can be adjusted via
`config.json` in `code` directory.

## Model Downloads

Download link for models used in the notebooks:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qkBhfhG3tDu6l4DQYRD4R7CIE8ImpcfK/view?usp=sharing

The `.zip` archive should contain two directories:
1. `shakespeare.distilbert-base-uncased.2`
2. `shakespeare.distilgpt2.8`

Both should be placed in this directory to be referenced by default from the
notebooks.
