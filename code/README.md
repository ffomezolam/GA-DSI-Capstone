# Code Directory

`/code/`

This directory contains all relevant scripts, configuration files, and
notebooks:

- `*.ipynb`: the notebooks with step-by-step detail of the modeling and
evaluation process.
- `config.json`: configuration file for running notebooks and supporting
code. To run custom models, copy and adjust this file, and change reference
variable in notebooks to match the file name.
- `stapp.py`: streamlit app code
- `utilities/`: subdirectory for helper modules. Contains code used throughout
to assist in text formatting, model loading, and generating model output.
