# Code Directory

`/code/`

This directory contains all relevant scripts, configuration files, and
notebooks:

- `*.ipynb`: the notebooks with step-by-step detail of the modeling and
evaluation process.
- `config*.json`: configuration files for running notebooks and supporting
code. By default `config.json` is used.
- `stapp.py`: streamlit app code
- `utilities/`: subdirectory for helper modules. Contains code used throughout
to assist in text formatting, model loading, and generating model output.
